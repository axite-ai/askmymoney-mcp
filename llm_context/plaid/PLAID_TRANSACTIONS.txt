Introduction to Investments
View holdings and transactions from investment accounts

Get started with Investments
Overview

The Investments product allows you to obtain holding, security, and transactions data for investment-type accounts in financial institutions within the United States and Canada. This data can be used for personal financial management tools and wealth management analysis.

Looking for Plaid's solution to automate ACATS transfers and avoid friction, failures, and delays due to manual data entry? See Investments Move instead.

Securities and holdings

The /investments/holdings/get endpoint provides both security data and holding data. Security data represents information about a specific security, such as its name, ticker symbol, and price. Security data is not specific to a user's account; any user who held the same security at the same financial institution at the same time would have identical security data.

Sample security data


{
  "close_price": 10.42,
  "close_price_as_of": null,
  "cusip": "258620103",
  "institution_id": null,
  "institution_security_id": null,
  "is_cash_equivalent": false,
  "isin": "US2586201038",
  "iso_currency_code": "USD",
  "name": "DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund",
  "proxy_security_id": null,
  "security_id": "NDVQrXQoqzt5v3bAe8qRt4A7mK7wvZCLEBBJk",
  "sedol": null,
  "ticker_symbol": "DBLTX",
  "type": "mutual fund",
  "unofficial_currency_code": null,
  "market_identifier_code": "XNAS",
  "option_contract": null
}
Holding data, by contrast, represents information about a user's specific ownership of that security, such as the number of shares owned and the cost basis. Each holding includes a security_id field that can be cross-referenced to a security for more detailed information about the security itself.

Sample holding data


{
  "account_id": "k67E4xKvMlhmleEa4pg9hlwGGNnnEeixPolGm",
  "cost_basis": 10,
  "institution_price": 10.42,
  "institution_price_as_of": null,
  "institution_value": 20.84,
  "iso_currency_code": "USD",
  "quantity": 2,
  "security_id": "NDVQrXQoqzt5v3bAe8qRt4A7mK7wvZCLEBBJk",
  "unofficial_currency_code": null
}
Transactions

The /investments/transactions/get endpoint provides up to 24 months of investment transactions data. The schema for investment transactions is not the same as for transactions data returned by the Transactions product, instead providing securities-specific information. Inflow, such as stock sales, is shown as a negative amount, and outflow, such as stock purchases, is positive. The /investments/transactions/get endpoint can only be used for investment-type accounts; for obtaining transaction history for other account types, use Transactions.

Sample transaction data


{
  "account_id": "rz99ex9ZQotvnjXdgQLEsR81e3ArPgulVWjGj",
  "amount": -8.72,
  "cancel_transaction_id": null,
  "date": "2020-05-29",
  "fees": 0,
  "investment_transaction_id": "oq99Pz97joHQem4BNjXECev1E4B6L6sRzwANW",
  "iso_currency_code": "USD",
  "name": "INCOME DIV DIVIDEND RECEIVED",
  "price": 0,
  "quantity": 0,
  "security_id": "eW4jmnjd6AtjxXVrjmj6SX1dNEdZp3Cy8RnRQ",
  "subtype": "dividend",
  "type": "cash",
  "unofficial_currency_code": null
}
Investments transactions initialization behavior

Unlike the Transactions product, Investments Transactions operates synchronously by default and will not fire a webhook to indicate when initial data is ready for an Item. If investments transactions data is not ready when /investments/transactions/get is first called, Plaid will wait for the data. For this reason, calling /investments/transactions/get immediately after Link may take up to one to two minutes to return.

If you are adding Investments to an Item by calling /investments/transactions/get after the Item was originally linked, instead of specifying the Investments product while calling /link/token/create, you can optionally request asynchronous behavior by specifying async_update=true. In this case, Investments will fire a HISTORICAL_UPDATE webhook when data is ready to be fetched. In all other scenarios, Investments endpoints will operate synchronously and will not fire a webhook to indicate when the Item's initial data is available to be fetched.

Investments updates and webhooks

Investments data is not static, since users' holdings will change as they trade and as market prices fluctuate. Plaid typically checks for updates to investment data overnight, after market hours. You can also request an update on-demand via the /investments/refresh endpoint, which is available as an add-on for Investments customers. To request access to this endpoint, submit a product access request or contact your Plaid account manager.

There are two webhooks that are used for informing you of changes to investment data. The DEFAULT_UPDATE webhook of type HOLDINGS fires when new holdings have been detected or the quantity or price of an existing holding has changed. The DEFAULT_UPDATE webhook of type INVESTMENTS_TRANSACTIONS fires when a new or canceled investment transaction has been detected.

When updating an Item with new Investments transactions data, it is recommended to call /investments/transactions/get with only the date range that needs to be updated, rather than the maximum available date range, in order to reduce the amount of data that you must receive and process.

Investments institution coverage

By default, Investments provides access to data at over 2,400 institutions in the US and Canada. For details, see Institution Coverage.

Access to Fidelity Investments is available upon request. To request access, contact your Plaid Account Manager.

Testing Investments

Investments can be tested in Sandbox without any additional permissions.

To test with realistic data, use the custom user. If provided real-world ticker symbols, Plaid will automatically populate securities with realistic data for both options and contracts. For examples, see the sample Investments custom user.

When using the custom Sandbox user, Investments must be placed in the products array of /link/token/create and cannot be used in the optional_products, additional_consented_products, or required_if_supported_products array. Omitting investments from the products array may cause custom Sandbox investments data not to be loaded.

Investments pricing

Investments is billed on a subscription model; Investments Refresh is billed on a per-request flat fee model. To view the exact pricing you may be eligible for, apply for Production access or contact Sales. For more details about pricing and billing models, see Plaid billing.

Endpoints

/transactions/sync

If you are migrating to /transactions/sync from an existing /transactions/get integration, also refer to the Transactions Sync migration guide.
Get incremental transaction updates on an Item

The /transactions/sync endpoint retrieves transactions associated with an Item and can fetch updates using a cursor to track which updates have already been seen.
For important instructions on integrating with /transactions/sync, see the Transactions integration overview. If you are migrating from an existing integration using /transactions/get, see the Transactions Sync migration guide.
This endpoint supports credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype student). For investments accounts, use /investments/transactions/get instead.
When retrieving paginated updates, track both the next_cursor from the latest response and the original cursor from the first call in which has_more was true; if a call to /transactions/sync fails when retrieving a paginated update (e.g due to the TRANSACTIONS_SYNC_MUTATION_DURING_PAGINATION error), the entire pagination request loop must be restarted beginning with the cursor for the first page of the update, rather than retrying only the single request that failed.
If transactions data is not yet available for the Item, which can happen if the Item was not initialized with transactions during the /link/token/create call or if /transactions/sync was called within a few seconds of Item creation, /transactions/sync will return empty transactions arrays.
Plaid typically checks for new transactions data between one and four times per day, depending on the institution. To find out when transactions were last updated for an Item, use the Item Debugger or call /item/get; the item.status.transactions.last_successful_update field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, use the /transactions/refresh endpoint.
To be alerted when new transactions are available, listen for the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook.

Request fields
Collapse all
client_id
string
Your Plaid API client_id. The client_id is required and may be provided either in the PLAID-CLIENT-ID header or as part of a request body.
access_token
required
string
The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.
secret
string
Your Plaid API secret. The secret is required and may be provided either in the PLAID-SECRET header or as part of a request body.
cursor
string
The cursor value represents the last update requested. Providing it will cause the response to only return changes after this update.
If omitted, the entire history of updates will be returned, starting with the first-added transactions on the Item. The cursor also accepts the special value of "now", which can be used to fast-forward the cursor as part of migrating an existing Item from /transactions/get to /transactions/sync. For more information, see the Transactions sync migration guide. Note that using the "now" value is not supported for any use case other than migrating existing Items from /transactions/get.
The upper-bound length of this cursor is 256 characters of base64.
count
integer
The number of transaction updates to fetch.

Default: 100
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 500
Exclusive min: false
options
object
An optional object to be used with the request. If specified, options must not be null.
Hide object
include_original_description
boolean
Include the raw unparsed transaction description from the financial institution.

Default: false
days_requested
integer
This field only applies to calls for Items where the Transactions product has not already been initialized (i.e., by specifying transactions in the products, required_if_supported_products, or optional_products array when calling /link/token/create or by making a previous call to /transactions/sync or /transactions/get). In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default.
If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the /link/token/create call (e.g. by including transactions in the /link/token/create products array), you must use the transactions.days_requested field in the /link/token/create request instead of in the /transactions/sync request.
If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via /item/remove and send the user through Link to create a new Item.
Customers using Recurring Transactions should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.

Minimum: 1
Maximum: 730
Default: 90
account_id
string
If provided, the returned updates and cursor will only reflect the specified account's transactions. Omitting account_id returns updates for all accounts under the Item. Note that specifying an account_id effectively creates a separate incremental update stream—and therefore a separate cursor—for that account. If multiple accounts are queried this way, you will maintain multiple cursors, one per account_id.
If you decide to begin filtering by account_id after using no account_id, start fresh with a null cursor and maintain separate (account_id, cursor) pairs going forward. Do not reuse any previously saved cursors, as this can cause pagination errors or incomplete data.
Note: An error will be returned if a provided account_id is not associated with the Item.

transactions_update_status
string
A description of the update status for transaction pulls of an Item. This field contains the same information provided by transactions webhooks, and may be helpful for webhook troubleshooting or when recovering from missed webhooks.
TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN: Unable to fetch transactions update status for Item.
NOT_READY: The Item is pending transaction pull.
INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE: Initial pull for the Item is complete, historical pull is pending.
HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE: Both initial and historical pull for Item are complete.

Possible values: TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE_STATUS_UNKNOWN, NOT_READY, INITIAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE, HISTORICAL_UPDATE_COMPLETE
accounts
[object]
An array of accounts at a financial institution associated with the transactions in this response. Only accounts that have associated transactions will be shown. For example, investment-type accounts will be omitted.
Hide object
account_id
string
Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new account_id will be assigned to the account.
The account_id can also change if the access_token is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that access_token are used to generate a new access_token on a later date. In that case, the new account_id will be different from the old account_id.
If an account with a specific account_id disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with /cra/), the account_id returned will not match the account_id returned by a non-CRA endpoint.
Like all Plaid identifiers, the account_id is case sensitive.
balances
object
A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by /accounts/balance/get or /signal/evaluate (using a Balance-only ruleset).
Hide object
available
nullable
number
The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.
For credit-type accounts, the available balance typically equals the limit less the current balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.
For depository-type accounts, the available balance typically equals the current balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For depository-type accounts, the available balance does not include the overdraft limit.
For investment-type accounts (or brokerage-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the available balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.
Note that not all institutions calculate the available  balance. In the event that available balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an available balance value of null.
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by /accounts/balance/get, or by /signal/evaluate with a Balance-only ruleset.
If current is null this field is guaranteed not to be null.

Format: double
current
nullable
number
The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.
For credit-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.
For loan-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (ins_116944). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to credit-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.
For investment-type accounts (or brokerage-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by /accounts/balance/get or by /signal/evaluate with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the available balance as provided by /accounts/balance/get or /signal/evaluate called with a Balance-only ruleset_key.
When returned by /accounts/balance/get, this field may be null. When this happens, available is guaranteed not to be null.

Format: double
limit
nullable
number
For credit-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.
For depository-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.
In North America, this field is typically only available for credit-type accounts.

Format: double
iso_currency_code
nullable
string
The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if unofficial_currency_code is non-null.
unofficial_currency_code
nullable
string
The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if iso_currency_code is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.
See the currency code schema for a full listing of supported unofficial_currency_codes.
last_updated_datetime
nullable
string
Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) indicating the last time the balance was updated.
This field is returned only when the institution is ins_128026 (Capital One).

Format: date-time
mask
nullable
string
The last 2-4 alphanumeric characters of either the account’s displayed mask or the account’s official account number. Note that the mask may be non-unique between an Item’s accounts.
name
string
The name of the account, either assigned by the user or by the financial institution itself
official_name
nullable
string
The official name of the account as given by the financial institution

verification_status
string
Indicates an Item's micro-deposit-based verification or database verification status. This field is only populated when using Auth and falling back to micro-deposit or database verification. Possible values are:
pending_automatic_verification: The Item is pending automatic verification.
pending_manual_verification: The Item is pending manual micro-deposit verification. Items remain in this state until the user successfully verifies the code.
automatically_verified: The Item has successfully been automatically verified.
manually_verified: The Item has successfully been manually verified.
verification_expired: Plaid was unable to automatically verify the deposit within 7 calendar days and will no longer attempt to validate the Item. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.
verification_failed: The Item failed manual micro-deposit verification because the user exhausted all 3 verification attempts. Users may retry by submitting their information again through Link.
unsent: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.
database_insights_pending: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.
database_insights_fail: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid. Typically this indicates that the routing number is invalid, the account number does not match the account number format associated with the routing number, or the account has been reported as closed or frozen. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_insights_pass: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_insights_pass_with_caution: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_matched: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.
null or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.

Possible values: automatically_verified, pending_automatic_verification, pending_manual_verification, unsent, manually_verified, verification_expired, verification_failed, database_matched, database_insights_pass, database_insights_pass_with_caution, database_insights_fail
verification_name
string
The account holder name that was used for micro-deposit and/or database verification. Only returned for Auth Items created via micro-deposit or database verification. This name was manually-entered by the user during Link, unless it was otherwise provided via the user.legal_name request field in /link/token/create for the Link session that created the Item.
verification_insights
object
Insights from performing database verification for the account. Only returned for Auth Items using Database Auth.
Hide object
name_match_score
nullable
integer
Indicates the score of the name match between the given name provided during database verification (available in the verification_name field) and matched Plaid network accounts. If defined, will be a value between 0 and 100. Will be undefined if name matching was not enabled for the database verification session or if there were no eligible Plaid network matches to compare the given name with.
network_status
object
Status information about the account and routing number in the Plaid network.
Hide object
has_numbers_match
boolean
Indicates whether we found at least one matching account for the ACH account and routing number.

Indicator of account number format validity for institution.
valid: indicates that the account number has a correct format for the institution.
invalid: indicates that the account number has an incorrect format for the institution.
unknown: indicates that there was not enough information to determine whether the format is correct for the institution.

Possible values: valid, invalid, unknown
persistent_account_id
string
A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (ins_56, ins_13) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (ins_127287); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.
holder_category
nullable
string
Indicates the account's categorization as either a personal or a business account. This field is currently in beta; to request access, contact your account manager.

Possible values: business, personal, unrecognized

Format: double
iso_currency_code
nullable
string
The ISO-4217 currency code of the transaction. Always null if unofficial_currency_code is non-null.
unofficial_currency_code
nullable
string
The unofficial currency code associated with the transaction. Always null if iso_currency_code is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.

check_number
nullable
string
The check number of the transaction. This field is only populated for check transactions.
date
string
For pending transactions, the date that the transaction occurred; for posted transactions, the date that the transaction posted. Both dates are returned in an ISO 8601 format ( YYYY-MM-DD ). To receive information about the date that a posted transaction was initiated, see the authorized_date field.

Format: date
location
object
A representation of where a transaction took place. Location data is provided only for transactions at physical locations, not for online transactions. Location data availability depends primarily on the merchant and is most likely to be populated for transactions at large retail chains; small, local businesses are less likely to have location data available.
Hide object
address
nullable
string
The street address where the transaction occurred.
city
nullable
string
The city where the transaction occurred.
region
nullable
string
The region or state where the transaction occurred. In API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier, this field is called state.

store_number
nullable
string
The merchant defined store number where the transaction occurred.
name
deprecated
string
The merchant name or transaction description.
Note: While Plaid does not currently plan to remove this field, it is a legacy field that is not actively maintained. Use merchant_name instead for the merchant name.
If the transactions object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as /transactions/sync or /transactions/get, this field will always appear. If the transactions object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as /asset_report/get/ or /asset_report/pdf/get, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
merchant_name
nullable
string
The merchant name, as enriched by Plaid from the name field. This is typically a more human-readable version of the merchant counterparty in the transaction. For some bank transactions (such as checks or account transfers) where there is no meaningful merchant name, this value will be null.
original_description
nullable
string
The string returned by the financial institution to describe the transaction. For transactions returned by /transactions/sync or /transactions/get, this field will only be included if the client has set options.include_original_description to true.
payment_meta
object
Transaction information specific to inter-bank transfers. If the transaction was not an inter-bank transfer, all fields will be null.
If the transactions object was returned by a Transactions endpoint such as /transactions/sync or /transactions/get, the payment_meta key will always appear, but no data elements are guaranteed. If the transactions object was returned by an Assets endpoint such as /asset_report/get/ or /asset_report/pdf/get, this field will only appear in an Asset Report with Insights.
Hide object
reference_number
nullable
string
The transaction reference number supplied by the financial institution.

reason
nullable
string
The payer-supplied description of the transfer.
pending
boolean
When true, identifies the transaction as pending or unsettled. Pending transaction details (name, type, amount, category ID) may change before they are settled. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
pending_transaction_id
nullable
string
The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
account_owner
nullable
string
This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts. A sub-account most commonly exists in cases where a single account is linked to multiple cards, each with its own card number and card holder name; each card will be considered a sub-account. If the account does have sub-accounts, this field will typically be some combination of the sub-account owner's name and/or the sub-account mask. The format of this field is not standardized and will vary based on institution.
transaction_id
string
The unique ID of the transaction. Like all Plaid identifiers, the transaction_id is case sensitive.
transaction_type
deprecated
string
Please use the payment_channel field, transaction_type will be deprecated in the future.

/transactions/get

Get transaction data

Note: All new implementations are encouraged to use /transactions/sync rather than /transactions/get. /transactions/sync provides the same functionality as /transactions/get and improves developer ease-of-use for handling transactions updates.
The /transactions/get endpoint allows developers to receive user-authorized transaction data for credit, depository, and some loan-type accounts (only those with account subtype student; coverage may be limited). For transaction history from investments accounts, use the Investments endpoint instead. Transaction data is standardized across financial institutions, and in many cases transactions are linked to a clean name, entity type, location, and category. Similarly, account data is standardized and returned with a clean name, number, balance, and other meta information where available.
Transactions are returned in reverse-chronological order, and the sequence of transaction ordering is stable and will not shift. Transactions are not immutable and can also be removed altogether by the institution; a removed transaction will no longer appear in /transactions/get. For more details, see Pending and posted transactions.
Due to the potentially large number of transactions associated with an Item, results are paginated. Manipulate the count and offset parameters in conjunction with the total_transactions response body field to fetch all available transactions.
Data returned by /transactions/get will be the data available for the Item as of the most recent successful check for new transactions. Plaid typically checks for new data multiple times a day, but these checks may occur less frequently, such as once a day, depending on the institution. To find out when the Item was last updated, use the Item Debugger or call /item/get; the item.status.transactions.last_successful_update field will show the timestamp of the most recent successful update. To force Plaid to check for new transactions, you can use the /transactions/refresh endpoint.
Note that data may not be immediately available to /transactions/get. Plaid will begin to prepare transactions data upon Item link, if Link was initialized with transactions, or upon the first call to /transactions/get, if it wasn't. To be alerted when transaction data is ready to be fetched, listen for the INITIAL_UPDATE and HISTORICAL_UPDATE webhooks. If no transaction history is ready when /transactions/get is called, it will return a PRODUCT_NOT_READY error.

Request fields
Collapse all
client_id
string
Your Plaid API client_id. The client_id is required and may be provided either in the PLAID-CLIENT-ID header or as part of a request body.
options
object
An optional object to be used with the request. If specified, options must not be null.
Hide object
account_ids
[string]
A list of account_ids to retrieve for the Item
Note: An error will be returned if a provided account_id is not associated with the Item.
count
integer
The number of transactions to fetch.

Default: 100
Minimum: 1
Maximum: 500
Exclusive min: false
offset
integer
The number of transactions to skip. The default value is 0.

Default: 0
Minimum: 0
include_original_description
boolean
Include the raw unparsed transaction description from the financial institution.

Default: false
days_requested
integer
This field only applies to calls for Items where the Transactions product has not already been initialized (i.e. by specifying transactions in the products, optional_products, or required_if_consented_products array when calling /link/token/create or by making a previous call to /transactions/sync or /transactions/get). In those cases, the field controls the maximum number of days of transaction history that Plaid will request from the financial institution. The more transaction history is requested, the longer the historical update poll will take. If no value is specified, 90 days of history will be requested by default. If a value under 30 is provided, a minimum of 30 days of history will be requested.
If you are initializing your Items with transactions during the /link/token/create call (e.g. by including transactions in the /link/token/create products array), you must use the transactions.days_requested field in the /link/token/create request instead of in the /transactions/get request.
If the Item has already been initialized with the Transactions product, this field will have no effect. The maximum amount of transaction history to request on an Item cannot be updated if Transactions has already been added to the Item. To request older transaction history on an Item where Transactions has already been added, you must delete the Item via /item/remove and send the user through Link to create a new Item.
Customers using Recurring Transactions should request at least 180 days of history for optimal results.

Minimum: 1
Maximum: 730
Default: 90
access_token
required
string
The access token associated with the Item data is being requested for.
secret
string
Your Plaid API secret. The secret is required and may be provided either in the PLAID-SECRET header or as part of a request body.
start_date
required
string
The earliest date for which data should be returned. Dates should be formatted as YYYY-MM-DD.

Format: date

Response fields
Collapse all
accounts
[object]
An array containing the accounts associated with the Item for which transactions are being returned. Each transaction can be mapped to its corresponding account via the account_id field.
Hide object
account_id
string
Plaid’s unique identifier for the account. This value will not change unless Plaid can't reconcile the account with the data returned by the financial institution. This may occur, for example, when the name of the account changes. If this happens a new account_id will be assigned to the account.
The account_id can also change if the access_token is deleted and the same credentials that were used to generate that access_token are used to generate a new access_token on a later date. In that case, the new account_id will be different from the old account_id.
If an account with a specific account_id disappears instead of changing, the account is likely closed. Closed accounts are not returned by the Plaid API.
When using a CRA endpoint (an endpoint associated with Plaid Check Consumer Report, i.e. any endpoint beginning with /cra/), the account_id returned will not match the account_id returned by a non-CRA endpoint.
Like all Plaid identifiers, the account_id is case sensitive.
balances
object
A set of fields describing the balance for an account. Balance information may be cached unless the balance object was returned by /accounts/balance/get or /signal/evaluate (using a Balance-only ruleset).
Hide object
available
nullable
number
The amount of funds available to be withdrawn from the account, as determined by the financial institution.
For credit-type accounts, the available balance typically equals the limit less the current balance, less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows.
For depository-type accounts, the available balance typically equals the current balance less any pending outflows plus any pending inflows. For depository-type accounts, the available balance does not include the overdraft limit.
For investment-type accounts (or brokerage-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the available balance is the total cash available to withdraw as presented by the institution.
Note that not all institutions calculate the available  balance. In the event that available balance is unavailable, Plaid will return an available balance value of null.
Available balance may be cached and is not guaranteed to be up-to-date in realtime unless the value was returned by /accounts/balance/get, or by /signal/evaluate with a Balance-only ruleset.
If current is null this field is guaranteed not to be null.

Format: double
current
nullable
number
The total amount of funds in or owed by the account.
For credit-type accounts, a positive balance indicates the amount owed; a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.
For loan-type accounts, the current balance is the principal remaining on the loan, except in the case of student loan accounts at Sallie Mae (ins_116944). For Sallie Mae student loans, the account's balance includes both principal and any outstanding interest. Similar to credit-type accounts, a positive balance is typically expected, while a negative amount indicates the lender owing the account holder.
For investment-type accounts (or brokerage-type accounts for API versions 2018-05-22 and earlier), the current balance is the total value of assets as presented by the institution.
Note that balance information may be cached unless the value was returned by /accounts/balance/get or by /signal/evaluate with a Balance-only ruleset; if the Item is enabled for Transactions, the balance will be at least as recent as the most recent Transaction update. If you require realtime balance information, use the available balance as provided by /accounts/balance/get or /signal/evaluate called with a Balance-only ruleset_key.
When returned by /accounts/balance/get, this field may be null. When this happens, available is guaranteed not to be null.

Format: double
limit
nullable
number
For credit-type accounts, this represents the credit limit.
For depository-type accounts, this represents the pre-arranged overdraft limit, which is common for current (checking) accounts in Europe.
In North America, this field is typically only available for credit-type accounts.

Format: double
iso_currency_code
nullable
string
The ISO-4217 currency code of the balance. Always null if unofficial_currency_code is non-null.
unofficial_currency_code
nullable
string
The unofficial currency code associated with the balance. Always null if iso_currency_code is non-null. Unofficial currency codes are used for currencies that do not have official ISO currency codes, such as cryptocurrencies and the currencies of certain countries.
See the currency code schema for a full listing of supported unofficial_currency_codes.
last_updated_datetime
nullable
string
Timestamp in ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ) indicating the last time the balance was updated.
This field is returned only when the institution is ins_128026 (Capital One).

unsent: The Item is pending micro-deposit verification, but Plaid has not yet sent the micro-deposit.
database_insights_pending: The Database Auth result is pending and will be available upon Auth request.
database_insights_fail: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have signal for being invalid and/or have no signal for being valid.

Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_insights_pass: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources: the routing and account number match a routing and account number of an account recognized on the Plaid network, and the account is not known by Plaid to be frozen or closed. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_insights_pass_with_caution: The Item's numbers have been verified using Plaid's data sources and have some signal for being valid: the routing and account number were not recognized on the Plaid network, but the routing number is valid and the account number is a potential valid account number for that routing number. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Auth.
database_matched: (deprecated) The Item has successfully been verified using Plaid's data sources. Only returned for Auth Items created via Database Match.
null or empty string: Neither micro-deposit-based verification nor database verification are being used for the Item.

Possible values: automatically_verified, pending_automatic_verification, pending_manual_verification, unsent, manually_verified, verification_expired, verification_failed, database_matched, database_insights_pass, database_insights_pass_with_caution, database_insights_fail
verification_name
string
The account holder name that was used for micro-deposit and/or database verification. Only returned for Auth Items created via micro-deposit or database verification.

Possible values: valid, invalid, unknown
persistent_account_id
string
A unique and persistent identifier for accounts that can be used to trace multiple instances of the same account across different Items for depository accounts. This field is currently supported only for Items at institutions that use Tokenized Account Numbers (i.e., Chase and PNC, and in May 2025 US Bank). Because these accounts have a different account number each time they are linked, this field may be used instead of the account number to uniquely identify an account across multiple Items for payments use cases, helping to reduce duplicate Items or attempted fraud. In Sandbox, this field is populated for TAN-based institutions (ins_56, ins_13) as well as the OAuth Sandbox institution (ins_127287); in Production, it will only be populated for accounts at applicable institutions.

string
The ID of a posted transaction's associated pending transaction, where applicable. Not all institutions provide pending transactions.
account_owner
nullable
string
This field is not typically populated and only relevant when dealing with sub-accounts. A sub-account most commonly exists in cases where a single account is linked to multiple cards, each with its own card number and card holder name; each card will be considered a sub-account.

Format: date
authorized_datetime
nullable
string
Date and time when a transaction was authorized in ISO 8601 format ( YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ ). For posted transactions, the datetime field will indicate the posted date, but authorized_datetime will indicate the day the transaction was authorized by the financial institution. If presenting transactions to the user in a UI, the authorized_datetime, when available, is generally preferable to use over the datetime field for posted transactions, as it will generally represent the date the user actually made the transaction.
This field is returned for select financial institutions and comes as provided by the institution. It may contain default time values (such as 00:00:00). This field is only populated in API version 2019-05-29 and later.

webhook
nullable
string
The URL registered to receive webhooks for the Item.
auth_method

string
The method used to populate Auth data for the Item. This field is only populated for Items that have had Auth numbers data set on at least one of its accounts, and will be null otherwise. For info about the various flows, see our Auth coverage documentation.
INSTANT_AUTH: The Item's Auth data was provided directly by the user's institution connection.
INSTANT_MATCH: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Instant Match fallback flow.
AUTOMATED_MICRODEPOSITS: The Item's Auth data was provided via the Automated Micro-deposits flow.

error
nullable
object
Errors are identified by error_code and categorized by error_type. Use these in preference to HTTP status codes to identify and handle specific errors. HTTP status codes are set and provide the broadest categorization of errors: 4xx codes are for developer- or user-related errors, and 5xx codes are for Plaid-related errors, and the status will be 2xx in non-error cases. An Item with a non-null error object will only be part of an API response when calling /item/get to view Item status. Otherwise, error fields will be null if no error has occurred; if an error has occurred, an error code will be returned instead.

/transactions/recurring/get

Fetch recurring transaction streams

The /transactions/recurring/get endpoint allows developers to receive a summary of the recurring outflow and inflow streams (expenses and deposits) from a user’s checking, savings or credit card accounts. Additionally, Plaid provides key insights about each recurring stream including the category, merchant, last amount, and more. Developers can use these insights to build tools and experiences that help their users better manage cash flow, monitor subscriptions, reduce spend, and stay on track with bill payments.
This endpoint is offered as an add-on to Transactions. To request access to this endpoint, submit a product access request or contact your Plaid account manager.
This endpoint can only be called on an Item that has already been initialized with Transactions (either during Link, by specifying it in /link/token/create; or after Link, by calling /transactions/get or /transactions/sync).
When using Recurring Transactions, for best results, make sure to use the days_requested parameter to request at least 180 days of history when initializing Items with Transactions. Once all historical transactions have been fetched, call /transactions/recurring/get to receive the Recurring Transactions streams and subscribe to the RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE webhook. To know when historical transactions have been fetched, if you are using /transactions/sync listen for the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook and check that the historical_update_complete field in the payload is true. If using /transactions/get, listen for the HISTORICAL_UPDATE webhook.
After the initial call, you can call /transactions/recurring/get endpoint at any point in the future to retrieve the latest summary of recurring streams. Listen to the RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE webhook to be notified when new updates are available.

boolean
Indicates whether the transaction stream is still live.
status
string
The current status of the transaction stream.
MATURE: A MATURE recurring stream should have at least 3 transactions and happen on a regular cadence (For Annual recurring stream, we will mark it MATURE after 2 instances).
EARLY_DETECTION: When a recurring transaction first appears in the transaction history and before it fulfills the requirement of a mature stream, the status will be EARLY_DETECTION.
TOMBSTONED: A stream that was previously in the EARLY_DETECTION status will move to the TOMBSTONED status when no further transactions were found at the next expected date.
UNKNOWN: A stream is assigned an UNKNOWN status when none of the other statuses are applicable.

Possible values: UNKNOWN, MATURE, EARLY_DETECTION, TOMBSTONED
personal_finance_category
nullable
object
Information describing the intent of the transaction. Most relevant for personal finance use cases, but not limited to such use cases.
See the taxonomy CSV file for a full list of personal finance categories. If you are migrating to personal finance categories from the legacy categories, also refer to the migration guide.
Hide object
primary
string
A high level category that communicates the broad category of the transaction.
detailed
string
A granular category conveying the transaction's intent. This field can also be used as a unique identifier for the category.

/transactions/refresh

Refresh transaction data

/transactions/refresh is an optional endpoint that initiates an on-demand extraction to fetch the newest transactions for an Item. The on-demand extraction takes place in addition to the periodic extractions that automatically occur one or more times per day for any Transactions-enabled Item. The Item must already have Transactions added as a product in order to call /transactions/refresh.
If changes to transactions are discovered after calling /transactions/refresh, Plaid will fire a webhook: for /transactions/sync users, SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE will be fired if there are any transactions updated, added, or removed. For users of both /transactions/sync and /transactions/get, TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED will be fired if any removed transactions are detected, and DEFAULT_UPDATE will be fired if any new transactions are detected. New transactions can be fetched by calling /transactions/get or /transactions/sync.
Note that the /transactions/refresh endpoint is not supported for Capital One (ins_128026) non-depository accounts and will result in a PRODUCTS_NOT_SUPPORTED error if called on an Item that contains only non-depository accounts from that institution.
As this endpoint triggers a synchronous request for fresh data, latency may be higher than for other Plaid endpoints (typically less than 10 seconds, but occasionally up to 30 seconds or more); if you encounter errors, you may find it necessary to adjust your timeout period when making requests.
/transactions/refresh is offered as an optional add-on to Transactions and has a separate fee model. To request access to this endpoint, submit a product access request or contact your Plaid account manager.

Webhooks

You can receive notifications via a webhook whenever there are new transactions associated with an Item, including when Plaid’s initial and historical transaction pull are completed. All webhooks related to transactions have a webhook_type of TRANSACTIONS.

SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE

Fired when an Item's transactions change. This can be due to any event resulting in new changes, such as an initial 30-day transactions fetch upon the initialization of an Item with transactions, the backfill of historical transactions that occurs shortly after, or when changes are populated from a regularly-scheduled transactions update job. It is recommended to listen for the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook when using the /transactions/sync endpoint. Note that when using /transactions/sync the older webhooks INITIAL_UPDATE, HISTORICAL_UPDATE, DEFAULT_UPDATE, and TRANSACTIONS_REMOVED, which are intended for use with /transactions/get, will also continue to be sent in order to maintain backwards compatibility. It is not necessary to listen for and respond to those webhooks when using /transactions/sync.
After receipt of this webhook, the new changes can be fetched for the Item from /transactions/sync.
Note that to receive this webhook for an Item, /transactions/sync must have been called at least once on that Item. This means that, unlike the INITIAL_UPDATE and HISTORICAL_UPDATE webhooks, it will not fire immediately upon Item creation. If /transactions/sync is called on an Item that was not initialized with Transactions, the webhook will fire twice: once the first 30 days of transactions data has been fetched, and a second time when all available historical transactions data has been fetched.
This webhook will fire in the Sandbox environment as it would in Production. It can also be manually triggered in Sandbox by calling /sandbox/item/fire_webhook.

RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE

Fired when recurring transactions data is updated. This includes when a new recurring stream is detected or when a new transaction is added to an existing recurring stream. The RECURRING_TRANSACTIONS_UPDATE webhook will also fire when one or more attributes of the recurring stream changes, which is usually a result of the addition, update, or removal of transactions to the stream.
After receipt of this webhook, the updated data can be fetched from /transactions/recurring/get.

INITIAL_UPDATE

Fired when an Item's initial transaction pull is completed. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data for the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. This webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with new_transactions set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.
This webhook is intended for use with /transactions/get; if you are using the newer /transactions/sync endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook instead.

}
HISTORICAL_UPDATE

Fired when an Item's historical transaction pull is completed and Plaid has prepared as much historical transaction data as possible for the Item. Once this webhook has been fired, transaction data beyond the most recent 30 days can be fetched for the Item. This webhook will also be fired if account selections for the Item are updated, with new_transactions set to the number of net new transactions pulled after the account selection update.
This webhook is intended for use with /transactions/get; if you are using the newer /transactions/sync endpoint, this webhook will still be fired to maintain backwards compatibility, but it is recommended to listen for and respond to the SYNC_UPDATES_AVAILABLE webhook instead.
